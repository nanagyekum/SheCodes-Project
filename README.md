# SheCodes-Project
This repository holds all my work from SheCodes. A coding workshop that gives women access to careers in technology.
I took a three-week beginners course on the SheCodes website; I learned coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My last homework assignment was the final project.
